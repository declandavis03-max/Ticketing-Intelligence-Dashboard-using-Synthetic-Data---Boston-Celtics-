# Introduction

The goal was to replicate how a professional sports organization might analyze:
- Fan satisfaction (NPS & experience scores)
- Opponent-driven revenue performance
- Social media engagement impact on ticket demand

The project demonstrates end-to-end analytics capabilities using:
- MySQL (Data modeling + SQL queries)
- Power BI (Dashboard development + DAX calculations)
- AI-generated synthetic datasets

End to End Analytics Pipeline:
Data Creation --> SQL Database --> SQL Joins and Queries --> Data Modeling --> Dashboard Deisgn --> Business Insights

On top of the project scope, this was one of my first porjects I have created from the ground up. I have gained insightful knowledge on how to work with datasets, write productive queries to gain information, and work with Power BI to turn those insights into visualizations to properly display information. I am pleasently pleased with this project, and am hopeful to build more projects with much greater detail! Open to any singihts on how to imporve my processes!

# Data 
Used AI generated data from Chat GPT. Prompted CHAT GPT to create four datasets. Datasets are all CSV files and have over 100 rows of data each set:
1) fans.csv
2) social_metrics.csv
3) survey.csv
4) ticket_sales.csv
