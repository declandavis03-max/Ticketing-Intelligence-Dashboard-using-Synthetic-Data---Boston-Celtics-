# Introduction
A multi-page Power BI analytics dashboard using AI-generated ticketing, social media, and fan survey data; modeled datasets in MySQL, SQL joins, and DAX measures to analyze relationships between fan engagement, revenue, and game demand.

The Project was to explore:

On top of the project scope, I persoanlly tried to build my skills in PowerBI as well as the MySQL space. With this project in mind, I have gained insightful knowledge on various aspects of potential decsions sports teams have to make every single game to maximize revenuue and satisfaction throughout the long season!
